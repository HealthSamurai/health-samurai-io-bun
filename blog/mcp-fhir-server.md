## The Setup MCP FHIR Server



### 1. Launch a New Aidbox Instance

Start by running the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
curl -JO https://aidbox.app/runme/mcp && docker compose up
```

This command will download the Docker Compose configuration file for the new Aidbox instance with the MCP server enabled and then launch the services.



### 2. Activate your Aidbox instance

Open your browser and go to `[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)` to activate your Aidbox instance:
![MCP FHIR Server get instance](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/58ecfb695710f07cd0a35e9c/681dcc4b6c17c6ef7be30d93_1.png)
Issuing a development license is free – just register in the [Aidbox user portal ](https://aidbox.app/ui/portal#/signin)and create a new development license.



### 3. Connect Your LLM Desktop Application to Use Aidbox MCP Server

To use Aidbox&#x27;s MCP Server with your local LLM desktop application – such as Claude Desktop – follow the steps below:

##### **Prerequisites**

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.
- Uninstalled all [Node.js versions below v18](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway/issues/19), as Claude Desktop may not function correctly with older versions.

##### **Configuration Steps for Claude Desktop**
- Open Settings → Developer → Edit Config
- Update the claude_desktop_config.json file with the following snippet:



```javascript
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aidbox": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@latitude-data/supergateway",
        "--sse",
        "http://localhost:8080/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Let&#x27;s See It in Action

Once everything is configured, you’re ready to interact with your FHIR server using **Claude Desktop** powered by the MCP protocol.



### Creating a Basic Patient Resource

We’ll start by creating a basic Patient resource:
![create patient in MCP FHIR Server](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/58ecfb695710f07cd0a35e9c/681dccba2c561199478a7569_2.png)
You’ll be prompted to allow Claude to use the external tool:
![cloud for MCP FHIR Server](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/58ecfb695710f07cd0a35e9c/681dccd60b5e391465a917b2_3.png)
That&#x27;s it! The Patient resource has been created:
![MCP FHIR Server result](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/58ecfb695710f07cd0a35e9c/681dccf98adfe6ff7368bd59_4.png)
Claude used the `create-fhir-resource` tool to interact with the [FHIR Server](https://www.health-samurai.io/fhir-server) and create the Patient resource. To verify it, open the Aidbox Console UI ([http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)), navigate to the Resource Browser, and confirm that the Patient was successfully created:
![resource for MCP FHIR Server](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/58ecfb695710f07cd0a35e9c/681dcd4536f3ac7558607465_5.png)


### Creating Related Resources

Let’s go a step further and create a couple of related resources:
![creating resource for MCP FHIR Server](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/58ecfb695710f07cd0a35e9c/681dcd50aa727b74bb5c88f1_6.png)
Here’s what’s interesting: while creating the Task resource, Claude received feedback from Aidbox, analyzed the root cause of any issues, and managed to fix them automatically.



### Creating a Profile-Conformant Resource

Now, let’s create a resource that conforms to a specific FHIR profile:
![create profile for MCP FHIR Server](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/58ecfb695710f07cd0a35e9c/681dcd97ba704342ad635bb1_7.png)


## Try It Yourself

Now it’s your turn! Setting up a development instance of [Aidbox](https://aidbox.app/) is completely free. Try integrating your own LLM application and start exploring how AI can streamline your FHIR workflows.
