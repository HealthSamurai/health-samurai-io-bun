Need to provide extra information to help users fill out complex questions?

Now, you can easily add links to field settings. Whether it's guidelines, manuals, or regulatory references, just add the link and an icon will appear next to the field. Users can click on the icon to view additional information in a new window, making forms clearer and more user-friendly without adding clutter.
