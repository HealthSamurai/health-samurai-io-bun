This hands-on session introduces SQL on FHIR, a specification that transforms nested FHIR data into flat, queryable tables. Led by Nikolai Ryzhikov, CTO of Health Samurai, at FHIR DevDays 2025, the workshop walks you through setting up a complete analytics environment and building real dashboards with patient data.

**This workshop is ideal for**: anyone who wants to run SQL on FHIR data.

**You'll learn to:** 

- Set up a complete analytics environment with Docker, PostgreSQL, Grafana, and Jupyter notebooks
- Create view definitions that flatten FHIR resources into queryable tables by use of five core functions (column, where, forEach, select, union)
- Build interactive dashboards in Grafana that show patient demographics, conditions by age group, and medication patterns
- Integrate with Python data science workflows and create lightweight JavaScript visualizations
- Work with real implementations across different databases while you use the same view definitions
