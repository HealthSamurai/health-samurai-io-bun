Healthcare audit isn’t “just logs.” Regulations expect an immutable record of every access, change, and disclosure of patient data (capturing who did what, when, from where, and why) available on demand to providers, patients, and regulators. Building that in-house is slow, expensive, and easy to get wrong.

That’s why we created [Auditbox](https://www.health-samurai.io/auditbox), an embeddable audit log service designed specifically for healthcare software. And now, we’re launching an Early Access Program, offering 12 months of free access so you can try it without risk.

## Why Audit Logging Is So Hard to Get Right

Healthcare regulations demand precise records of every action on patient data — who accessed it, when, and why. These records must be secure, tamper-proof, and ready to hand over at any time.

Teams often consider three main approaches:
- Build your own. 
Gives you full control, but usually takes months of engineering work, hundreds of thousands in costs, and the risk of missing compliance details.
- Use generic logging tools (Splunk, LogDNA, etc.). 
Strong tooling, but they lack healthcare semantics and require heavy customization to meet healthcare privacy rules and generate regulator-ready reports.
- Adopt cloud platform services (AWS, Google, Azure). 
Convenient if you already live in their ecosystems, but can’t run in hospital air-gapped environments and may lock you into unpredictable usage-based costs.

None of these are wrong — but they all come with trade-offs that slow teams down or leave compliance gaps.

## What Auditbox Gives You Instead

There are different ways to handle audit logs. With Auditbox, the key features are already in place:
- Correct audit content — User ID, patient ID, timestamps (access and activity), location/device, action type, data category, and source application with existing standards
- Regulator-ready reports included from the start.
- Tamper-evident records stored for the long term.
- Flexible deployment: works in the cloud, on hospital servers, or isolated networks.
- Quick integration with FHIR APIs and libraries.

Instead of stretching generic tools, you get a solution aligned with healthcare workflows — and it integrates in days, not months.

## Outcomes You Care About
- **Compliance confidence** — Meets ASTM E2147 expectations for content, immutability, retention, and reporting.
- **Lower risk and effort** — Replace ad-hoc pipelines and splintered dashboards with a single audit source of truth.
- **Faster investigations** — Purpose-built queries and exception reports cut incident response from days to hours.
- **Standards alignment** — Stay on the rails as requirements evolve without constant custom rework.

## Join the Early Access Program

This isn’t just a free trial. As an early access participant, you’ll:
- Use Auditbox free for 12+ months.
- Influence the roadmap with your feedback.
- Secure preferential pricing when the platform reaches general availability.
