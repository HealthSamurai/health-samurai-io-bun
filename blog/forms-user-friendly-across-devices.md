## User-Friendly medical forms

While forms automatically adapt to different screen sizes, you can now provide an even better experience by adding a short text version of your form’s content. This is perfect for smaller screens like mobile devices, with limited space.

Make sure your [medical form](https://www.health-samurai.io/forms-product) is always easy to navigate—no matter the device!
