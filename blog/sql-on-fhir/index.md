Last week [Ryan Brush](https://github.com/rbrush) (author of [Bunsen](https://github.com/cerner/bunsen) project) from Cerner published on Github the first version of the [SQL-on-FHIR draft](https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir). This will be a hot topic to discuss in the upcoming [FHIR Connectathon #19](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201809_FHIR_Storage_and_Analytics#SQL_on_FHIR).

The original idea is to develop white papers and/or specs on how to make FHIR and SQL work together for healthcare analytics, because in the near future we expect a lot of patient data will be available in the FHIR format so analysts can leverage the standardized FHIR data model.

Join the discussion in [zulip](https://chat.fhir.org/login/#narrow/stream/73-analytics-on.20FHIR/topic/FHIR.20foundation.20project) and on [github](https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir/issues)!
