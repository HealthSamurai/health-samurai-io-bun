Health Samurai has been developing health IT solutions for over a decade. In 2012, we learned about the FHIR standard and became one of the first companies to recognize its potential and use it in real projects. Since then, we’ve been active participants in the FHIR community, helping to shape the direction of the standard. We developed the Aidbox FHIR backend and CDR to help organizations build modern healthcare solutions. Our clients have already built cloud EHRs, analytics products, care coordination systems, mobile apps for patients and providers, and integration platforms on top of Aidbox.
