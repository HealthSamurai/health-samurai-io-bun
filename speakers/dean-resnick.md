Mr. Resnick has been working on data analysis and statistical programming for at least several decades. For more than 10 years he worked at the U.S. Census Bureau in the administrative record area. During this period, he developed a SAS based record-linkage module for high-volume linkages that is still being used at the Bureau. At NORC, much of his work is focused on record linkage and he has developed (in collaboration with colleagues) a new SAS-based record linkage package that incorporates the E-M algorithm and several enhanced strategies for improving the quality of record linkage analyses.
