I lead a portfolio of Generative AI products for Google Cloud. I enjoy building 0-1 products and leading teams to define, launch, and scale AI products. I’m particularly excited about applications of AI that unlock human creativity and productivity, and in domains of social impact such as healthcare, education, and climate change.
