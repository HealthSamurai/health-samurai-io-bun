Paul Lynch is technical lead of the Clinical Data Interoperability Team at the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). Since 2016, NLM has had a project (https://lhcforms.nlm.nih.gov) which since 2016 has been developing web services and open-source tools for FHIR.  Because many of these tools are questionnaire-related, Paul participates in the FHIR-I calls for Questionnaire and helps run the Questionnaire track at FHIR Connectathons.
