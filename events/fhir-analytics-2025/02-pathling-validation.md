# Validation of SQL on FHIR via Clinical Study Replication & Introduction to Pathling

John will present findings from the recent SQL on FHIR paper published in npj Digital Medicine. The paper documents the development and validation of a standard method for transforming FHIR data into tabular structures. John will examine the design principles behind the SQL on FHIR ViewDefinition, including the deliberate constraints that balance expressivity with implementation feasibility.
