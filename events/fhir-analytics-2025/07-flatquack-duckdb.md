# FlatQuack: FHIR Resources to SQL Tables with DuckDB

FlatQuack is an open source, SQL-on-FHIR View Definition to SQL compiler that targets DuckDB, a lightweight, high performance database engine. DuckDB can scale from running as a single executable that queries a directory of FHIR resources on a local machine to querying across billions of resources in the cloud. By compiling View Definitions to plain SQL, FlatQuack can be easily integrated into existing data pipelines.
