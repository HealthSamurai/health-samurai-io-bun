# Helios Software: High-performance Clinical Analytics with SQL on FHIR using Rust

Helios Software is an open source Rust implementation of SQL on FHIR that includes a simple CLI for batch transformations, a HTTP server ideal for microservices, and Python bindings for using SQL on FHIR directly in your data science and analytics projects. In this session, Steve will demonstrate a real-world laboratory analytics challenge across different workflows.
