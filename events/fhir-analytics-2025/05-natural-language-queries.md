# Natural Language Queries to SQL-on-FHIR

The goal is to answer population level questions over a FHIR server using natural language queries (NLQ). Building on top of the FHIR Analytics component of Open Health Stack, we show how large language models can be utilised to transform NLQ into SQL over flat tables derived from FHIR resources using SQL-on-FHIR standard.
