# FHIR Questionnaire-related tools from the National Library of Medicine

The presentation highlights a suite of FHIR Questionnaire tools developed by the NLM team. Key products include LHC-Forms, an open-source JavaScript widget for rendering and filling SDC-compliant forms; the NLM Form Builder for creating FHIR Questionnaires; and supporting tools like fhirpath.js (FHIRPath in JavaScript), the Clinical Table Search Service (for fast code lookup and ValueSet expansion), and UCUM validation libraries. The session demonstrates how these tools support advanced SDC features—such as pre-population, calculations, and extraction—across multiple FHIR versions, and showcases practical demos for building, validating, and rendering interoperable clinical forms.
