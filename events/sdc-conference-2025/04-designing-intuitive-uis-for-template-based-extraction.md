# Designing Intuitive UIs for Template-Based Extraction: Empowering Non-Tech Users

The presentation explores designing intuitive user interfaces for template-based extraction in FHIR SDC. It demonstrates how thoughtful UI/UX can make complex template-based extraction accessible to non-technical users, hiding technical details like FHIRPath and resource structure. The talk covers core concepts: mapping QuestionnaireResponses to structured FHIR resources, the power and flexibility of template-based extraction, and the challenges of authoring templates without a UI. Key features shown include TreeView-based navigation, smart lookups, automated data mapping, validation, and debugging tools. The session also shares lessons from developing Aidbox Forms and highlights the importance of user-friendly solutions for broader adoption of FHIR and SDC.
