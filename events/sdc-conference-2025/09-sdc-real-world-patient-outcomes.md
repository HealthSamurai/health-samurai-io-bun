# SDC in the real world: Capturing patient-reported outcomes

The presentation focuses on the real-world use of FHIR SDC for capturing Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), particularly through ICHOM standard sets. It discusses the importance of standardized, patient-centered outcomes for value-based healthcare (VBHC) and highlights ICHOM's global role in defining and digitizing these measures. The talk covers challenges in scaling PROMs implementation, the need for EMR integration, and demonstrates practical solutions using FHIR Questionnaires, form prepopulation, and data extraction. Emphasis is placed on interoperability, benchmarking, and the transformative potential of digital PROMs for improving healthcare quality and efficiency.
