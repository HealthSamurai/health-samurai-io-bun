# Low-Code FHIRPath Tools for Clinical Form Designers

The presentation introduces low-code FHIRPath tools for clinical form designers, focusing on making dynamic FHIR questionnaires accessible to non-programmers. It highlights the challenges clinicians face with FHIRPath—such as syntax and semantic errors—and presents a solution: a token-based, schema- and type-aware FHIRPath editor. This tool uses guided expression building, real-time evaluation, and macro tokens to eliminate common mistakes and simplify the creation of smart forms. The talk features live demos and discusses the roadmap for further enhancements, aiming to empower clinicians to build intelligent, error-free forms without deep technical knowledge.
