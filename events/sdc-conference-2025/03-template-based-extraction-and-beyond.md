# Template-Based Extraction and Beyond

The presentation provides an in-depth overview of FHIR SDC Extract—the process and tooling for extracting structured FHIR resources from completed SDC questionnaires. It explains the $extract operation, which transforms QuestionnaireResponses into FHIR resource bundles using several approaches: observation-based, definition-based, template-based (new and more flexible), and StructureMap-based extraction. The talk covers technical details such as mapping, context handling, and the use of FHIRPath expressions and extensions to control extraction logic. Real-world examples and tool recommendations (like FhirPath-Lab) illustrate how extraction supports interoperability and advanced healthcare workflows, with emphasis on recent updates in the SDC R4 specification.
