# Introduction to FHIR SDC

The presentation introduces FHIR Structured Data Capture (SDC)—a standard that enhances FHIR questionnaires for collecting and processing healthcare data. It explains how SDC enables the creation of complex forms with adaptive behavior, auto-population, calculations, modularity, and reusability. Special attention is given to workflow management, form rendering and validation, as well as integration with external data sources and support for standards like LOINC. The presentation is aimed at professionals implementing digital healthcare solutions and offers practical recommendations for using and extending SDC in clinical systems.
