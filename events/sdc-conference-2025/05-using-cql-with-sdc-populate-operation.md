# Using CQL with the SDC $populate operation

The presentation covers using Clinical Quality Language (CQL) with the SDC $populate operation to automate and enhance FHIR Questionnaire workflows. It focuses on building smart questionnaires that leverage CQL libraries for dynamic data retrieval, calculation, and logic, especially in the context of the Da Vinci Prior Authorization Burden Reduction DTR use case. Key topics include integrating CQL for pre-populating questionnaire fields from EHR data, supporting complex behaviors (like conditional logic and calculations), managing context and data requirements, and best practices for modular, reusable CQL assets. The session demonstrates how CQL empowers more intelligent, interoperable, and efficient clinical forms within FHIR-based healthcare applications.
