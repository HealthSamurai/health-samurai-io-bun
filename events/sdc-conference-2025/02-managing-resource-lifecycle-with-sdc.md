# Managing resource lifecycle with SDC

The presentation focuses on managing the resource lifecycle with SDC (Structured Data Capture). It explores how SDC can drive the creation, editing, and extraction of FHIR resources using advanced techniques like FHIRPathMappingLanguage and template-based extraction. The talk addresses practical challenges such as tracking change history, managing context in QuestionnaireResponses, and handling version-specific references. Real-world solutions and demos illustrate how Questionnaires serve as a bridge between FHIR data and user interfaces, enabling user-friendly change tracking and flexible data projections. The presentation emphasizes that while SDC IG is powerful for complex scenarios, sometimes custom approaches are necessary for sophisticated real-world implementations.
