          At Health Samurai, we want to transform care delivery with great

          We believe that an open, connected healthcare application ecosystem

          happen, we have a simple plan: give people the tools they need to

          way. We believe that when you empower people with the right data and
          tools, amazing things will happen. <br /> <br />
          That's how we believe we can change healthcare for good, and we're

          <p className="cosulting-text">
            Building a healthcare application is a complex, expensive, and
            time-consuming process that requires significant domain
            knowledge. We understand all too well how these barriers limit
            innovation, because we’ve been developing custom health IT solutions
            for our clients since 2004.  <br /> <br />
            In 2012, we came across the

              FHIR standard

             and immediately recognized its potential to transform health IT by
            simplifying the healthcare software development process, cutting
            costs and solving real business problems. We confirmed our intuition
            after using FHIR successfully in various client projects, and set
            out to create a FHIR platform that would make it easy for healthcare
            organizations to build complex solutions. <br /> <br />
            We took the best of everything we've learned about health IT in the
            last 14 years and built  <strong>Aidbox </strong>, our FHIR backend
            as a service. After seeing the benefits that Aidbox brings to our
            partners, we know that FHIR is a standard that is here to stay. 
            <br /> <br />
            We're FHIR trailblazers who are helping to create an open, connected
            healthcare ecosystem that supports innovation and
            collaboration.
